Team Reflection Meeting
Date: 10/09/2019
Present: Gavin Crowl, Jun Wang, Yifan Shi, Zhicheng Chen

During the Team Reflection meeting, we reflected over the Software Security Requirement assignment and the current Assurance Case assignment. 

While reflecting over the Software Security Requirement assignment, the team agreed that the main issue facing the team is lack of collaboration. The project board works really well for collaboration. Through the project board, everyone easily knew their assigned to-do tasks, and finished their task on time. The team agrees that the project board is not enough for collaboration. The team will begin committing their branches earlier so that other team members have enough time to review and suggest modifications before the due date. Also, communication will be improved though Slack by informing the team members their progress on deliverables. By committing branches earlier and increasing communication through Slack, the team is more confident an increase in collaboration will occur.

During the Assurance Case assignment, the team noticed there has been good progress on assigned tasks earlier than the last project assignment. The team is able to obtain useful feedback/comments from other team members. The discussions on our slack channel is very effective in improving quality of our assurance claims. Collaboration in our team is getting better and better!
