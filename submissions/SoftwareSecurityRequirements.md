### Documentation Review
##### Installation Settings
* Security has to be enabled explicitly using one of two GoCD's built-in authentication methods since a newly installed GoCD server does not require users to authenticate. You can choose either Password-file based authentication or LDAP/Active Directory authentication.
* You can also choose from a collection of community-maintained plugins for other methods of authentication, such as using Google or GitHub OAuth.
* Default disabled authentication is great for a trial. However, it is one of the first things you should change, as soon as you decide to use GoCD more widely.
##### General Settings

#### TLS/SSL settings
