Team Reflection Meeting
Date: 10/09/2019
Present: Gavin Crowl, Jun Wang, Yifan Shi, Zhicheng Chen

During the Team Reflection meeting, we reflected over our previous and current assignment. 

We have begun reviewing each others work. We still have trouble pushing "work-in-progress" into github, and we will continue to work on pushing "work-in-progress" prior to due dates.
