Team Reflection Meeting
Date: 12/5/2019
Present: Gavin Crowl, Jun Wang, Yifan Shi, Zhicheng Chen

During the Team Reflection meeting, we reflected on our previous and our final assignment.

The team uses Slack to collaborate with work. Discussions on Slack include progress details on individual tasks, and how to perform code review with manual review and static analysis tools.

The team is incrementally working on the project tasks throughout the work span, and updating the git repository with work-in-progress or posting their results on Slack.

In the last project, the team did not update their tasks with Github. The team is ensuring that each person is updating the project tasks. Additionally, the team is including the Reflection Meeting with the primary submission as an outside link to make sure the Reflection Meeting is easily found.

The team is using Grammerly to fix grammer issues with deliverables.
