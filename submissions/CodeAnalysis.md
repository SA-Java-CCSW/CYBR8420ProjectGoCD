## Code Review Strategy
Before diving into the detailed code analysis, we did a manual coarse-grained scan of GoCD's code base to see if there is any existance of most popular CWEs(Commone Weakness Enumeration) such as CWE-120/CWE-798/CWE-311/CWE-434/CWE-250/CWE-494/CWE-22/CWE-759. 

Then we started with reviewing our assurance cases, misuse cases, and threat model report. From the review, we discovered the most critical weakness areas in the software and decided to choose the checklist review strategy which is the most appropriate method for analyzing the code of large-scale projects like GoCD. To reduce the effort of going through all the codes for each line we decided to review all 12 items from our [checklist](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/Checklist.md).  

We analyzed our code in both automated and manual review process. The automated code review is performed using open source static code analysis tool called **SpotBugs and Findbugs**. The list of resultant vulnerabilities from the automated tool scan was narrowed down to analyze  **CWE(Common Weakness Enumeration)** that are related to our misuse case, assurance cases, and threat model and examined manually.

## Manual Code Review
**CWE-120: Classic buffer overflow**
It seems that the chance of popular classic buffer overflow (CWE-120) in Java is very small unless JNI(Java Native Interface) is used to call native codes written in c/c++. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/479701/does-java-have-buffer-overflows. Searches for keyword "native"  and "System.loadLibrary" under top-level gocd directory did not show any usage of JNI in GoCD. Therefore, GoCD does not seem to have CWE-120 issue.

**CWE-798 issue: Use of hardcoded credentials**
Search with command ( grep -R "password"|less ) showed many hardcoded credentials usage, but most of them are from source codes written to test GoCD's functionalities. The only concern we have found is use of hardcoded credentials in source file [SystemEnvironment.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/base/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/SystemEnvironment.java):  
public static GoSystemProperty<String> GO_AGENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD = new GoStringSystemProperty("go.agent.keystore.password", "agent5s0repa55w0rd");  
public static GoSystemProperty<String> GO_SERVER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD = new GoStringSystemProperty("go.server.keystore.password", "serverKeystorepa55w0rd");  
 Therefore, GoCD seems to have some CWE-798 issue.
 
 **CWE-311: Missing encryption**  
 TBD
 
 **CWE-434: Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type**  
By scanning output of 'grep -R upload|less' it seems that GoCD does not allow users to upload any files from its web GUI. The only file uploading feature in GoCD is to upload Artifact files generated by jobs on Go Agents to the predefined Artifact directory on Go Server. So, The issue of CWE-434 does not apply in GoCD.

**CWE-250: Execution with unnecessary privileges**  
TBD

**CWE-494: Download of code without integrity check**  
By scanning output of 'grep -R checksum|less' it seems that GoCD does use MD5 checksum to check integrity of all artifact files before using them. So, GoCD has taken care of issue CWE-494.

**CWE-22: Path traversal**  
By scanning output of 'grep -R path|less' it seems that there are many references to controllerBasePath() and scanning output of 'grep -R controllerBasePath|less' seems to show many GoCD's web GUI URLs for different controllers are defined in source file [Routes.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/spark/spark-base/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/spark/Routes.java). For example, the following codes defined URLs of login and logout pages:  
    public class LoginPage {  
        public static final String SPA_BASE = "/auth/login";  
    }  
    public class LogoutPage {  
        public static final String SPA_BASE = "/auth/logout";  
    }  
Therefore, GoCD does not seem to have CWE-22 issue.  
 
**CWE-759: Use of one-way hash without a salt**  
It seems that method hashCode() in source file [UsernamePassword.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/newsecurity/models/UsernamePassword.java) violates CWE-759.

**Checklist item 1: login/authentication components**  
Looks like [AuthenticationController.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/newsecurity/controllers/AuthenticationController.java) is the main source code for user login authentication in GoCD.  
Method performLogin() use local password file based authentication plugin to authenticate user login.  
Method redirectToThirdPartyLoginPage() redirect user's login request to proper third party login page based on the third party authentication plugin ID "pluginId".  
Method authenticateWithWebBasedPlugin() use proper third party authentication plugin to authenticate user login.  
It seems that GoCD does not support user account lockout after N unsuccessful login attempts. It only calls method badAuthentication() to show message "Invalid credentials. Either your username and password are incorrect, or there is a problem with your browser cookies. Please check with your administrator." when authentication fails.  
Method isSecurityEnabled() in [SecurityService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/SecurityService.java) and [GoConfigService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/GoConfigService.java) is to check if authentication has been enabled or not. By default authentication service is not enabled on a newly installed GoCD Server (See https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/dev_authentication.html).  
Many GoCD system environment constants are defined in source file [SystemEnvironment.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/base/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/SystemEnvironment.java).  
Looks like GoCD does not support IP range based ACL(Access Control List) even though there is a class called "GoAcl" in [GoAcl.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/security/GoAcl.java) which only determines if a username is contained in a list of authorizedUsers. It is used in method readAclBy() in [GoConfigService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/GoConfigService.java) to create a list of authorizedUsers to access a particular stage of some pipeline. In addition, it is used in method hasOperatePermissionForStage() in [SecurityService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/SecurityService.java) to determine if a particular user has operate permission for a particular stage of some pipeline.  
Overall, login/authentication components of GoCD could prevent Spoofing attacks after authentication service is enabled. However, it is better to implement IP range based ACL and auto-user account lockout after N unsuccessful login attempts to prevent DoS attacks.

**Checklist item 2: source materials validation components**   
TBD

**Checklist item 3: backup/restore components**  
[BackupsController.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/api/api-backups-v1/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/apiv1/admin/backups/BackupsController.java) is the main source code for user to perform the backup process in GoCD.
setupRoutes method handles backup content type, verify backup confirm and authentication processes.
create method handles request and response. Backup server runs based on the current user name and inform user the backup result.
verifyConfirmHeader method verify request to see if it is satisfied in certain condition.

[BackupConfigRepresenter.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/api/api-backup-config-v1/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/apiv1/backupconfig/representers/BackupConfigRepresenter.java) is code that allows user to configure backup settings for the GoCD server.
toJSON method and fromJSON method contain JSON object with information that lets user know about backup process is success or not.

**Checklist item 4: poll material source components**  
TBD

**Checklist item 5: pipeline workflow components**  
TBD

**Checklist item 6: web ui component**  
TBD

**Checklist item 7: material update sub-system(MCU) component**  
(ServerMaintenanceModeControllerv1.java)[https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/api/api-server-maintenance-mode-v1/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/apiv1/servermaintenancemode/ServerMaintenanceModeControllerV1.java] is the main source code to determine which the internal subsystems and processes continue to work.
enableMaintenanceModeState method handles the existing maintenance mode state and notice user with certain information by checking the existingMaintenanceModeState first to see if the server is available in maintenance mode. 
Comparing to the enableMaintenanceModestate method, disableMaintenanceModeState method works in the opposite way, it handles the existing maintenance mode state and notice user with certain information if the server is available.
getRunningJobs method return information about the current running job instances. In this method, each running pipe line instance in the GoDashboardPipeline is collected and return as a list object.

**Checklist item 8: pluign extension point component**  
TBD

**Checklist item 4: poll material source components**  
TBD

**Checklist item 5: pipeline workflow components**  
It seems that pipeline workflow components of GoCD mainly involves source files: [GoConfigService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/GoConfigService.java).

**Checklist item 6: web ui component**  
TBD

**Checklist item 7: material update sub-system(MCU) component**  
TBD

**Checklist item 8:  pluign extension point component**  
TBD

**Checklist item 9: authorization component**  
It seems that authorization component of GoCD mainly involves two source files: [SecurityService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/SecurityService.java) and [GoConfigService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/GoConfigService.java).  
Based on method isAdmin() in [SecurityConfig.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/config/config-api/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/config/SecurityConfig.java) there are three ways to get Administrator permission in GoCD:  
!isSecurityEnabled() means no authentication is enabled after initial GoCD installation by default.  
noAdminsConfigured() means no user is assigned Administrator role by default.  
adminsConfig.isAdmin(admin, rolesConfig.memberRoles(admin)) means the user is a member of Administrator role.  
This is consistent with GoCD's documentation https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/dev_authorization.html .  
Therefore, a new user is actually given Administrator permission if none of existing users has been assigned as Administrator role.  

Methods canEditPipeline(), isGroupAdministrator(), isUserAdminOfGroup(), isUserTemplateAdmin() in source file [GoConfigService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/GoConfigService.java) clearly showed GoCD's role-based authorization feature.  
Overall, authorization component of GoCD could prevent elevation of privileges attacks. However, giving a new user Administrator permission as default is not secure.  

**Checklist item 10: SSL/TLS component**  
TBD

**Checklist item 11: Check authentication configuration component against CSRF attack**  
TBD

**Checklist item 12: Investigate usage of JRuby on Rails framework against CSRF attack**  
(AgentsControllerV6.java)[https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/api/api-agents-v6/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/apiv6/agents/AgentsControllerV6.java] is the main source code to allow users with administrator role to manage agents.
update method determines agent’s update action of agent with its id. If the updateAgentAttributes successfully update the agent’s attribute, then call the handleUpdateAgentResponse method. Exception will be handled if the update attribute method throws exception.
bulkUpdate method handles attribute update of agent with certain id. If the update action is successfully finished, text explanation is printed out. Otherwise, exception is handled.
deleteAgents method accepts request to handle deletion of specific agent with text explanation if no exception occurs.
checkSecurityOr403 method handles GET request with apiAuthenticationHelper component.
handleCreateOrUpdateResponse method handles response of new agent’s register or update status’s of existing agent.
handleUpdateAgentResponse method handles response of specific agent’s update status and inform user with text explanation. 



## Automated Tool Scan
After exploring the DHS SWAMP scanning platform we attempted to use the system to scan the GoCD source code files. However, the SWAMP platform does not support JDK 11 or above which is required to build GoCD source codes to byte code. Therefore, we directly downloaded precompiled GoCD byte codes in .zip format from https://www.gocd.org/download/#zip and uploaded them to https://www.mir-swamp.org/ to perform various assessments on the byte codes. We did successfully use the SWAMP platform to scan the GoCD Java Bytecode with SpotBugs 3.1.12.  We also used the OWASP Dependency Check 2.1.1 tool to scan the Java code files, but it did not find any issues.

#### Findbugs 3.0.1
This tool was used in the SWAMP platform to scan the GoCD Java Bytecode.  

#### SpotBugs 3.1.12
This tool was used in the SWAMP platform to scan the GoCD Java Bytecode. As shown in the [summary](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-Scan-Summary.pdf) it has found total 40034 bugs. It turned out that only 152 bugs are related to security or malicious codes groups based on our manual scan of the generated assessment results. As a matter of fact only 23 lines of source codes are from GoCD, the rest are from third-party libraries which is beyond the scope of our code analysis. We further selected 10 bugs which are worth investigations by GoCD development team as show below:  
**Security Concern 1: Missing Support for Cipher Integrity Check(CWE-353)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-CIPHER_INTEGRITY-AESEncrypter.pdf) is due to usage of insecure Java Cipher API call Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding") in line 62 and 85 of source file [AESEncrypter.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/config/config-api/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/security/AESEncrypter.java). Even though GoCD does explicitly provide algorithm(AES), cipher mode(CBC) and padding scheme(PKCS5Padding) as the transformation to avoid the IND-CPA insecure ECB cipher mode as mentioned in a [software security research article](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2508859.2516693), it is still recommended to use more secure GCM cipher mode to mitigate this security concern.  
**Security Concern 2: Use of Hard-coded Password(CCWE-259)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-HARD_CODE_PASSWORD.pdf) is due to usage of hard-coded password in line 280 and 289 of source file [MaterialConfigs.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/config/config-api/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/config/materials/MaterialConfigs.java) and line 214/243/245 of source file [X509CertificateGenerator.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/security/X509CertificateGenerator.java). Hard-coded passwords should always be removed.  
**Security Concern 3: Use of Insufficiently Random Values(CWE-330)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-PREDICTABLE_RANDOM%20.pdf) is due to usage of less secure random number generator in line 82 of source file [DownloadAction.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/domain/DownloadAction.java), in line 264 of source file [X509CertificateGenerator.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/security/X509CertificateGenerator.java), and line 55 of source file [SystemUtil.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/base/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/SystemUtil.java). More secure java.security.SecureRandom API should be used.  
**Security Concern 4: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information(CWE-319)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-UNENCRYPTED_SOCKET.pdf) is due to usage of unencrypted Socket in line 136 of source file [SystemUtil.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/base/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/SystemUtil.java). A more secure SSL Socket should be used.  
**Security Concern 5: OS Command Injection(CWE-78)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-COMMAND_INJECTION.pdf) is due to usage of java/lang/ProcessBuilder.command in line 172 of source file [AgentProcessParentImpl.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/agent-process-launcher/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/agent/AgentProcessParentImpl.java), line 37 of source file [ProcessRunner.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/util/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/command/ProcessRunner.java), line 48 of source file [ProcessManager.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/commandline/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/ProcessManager.java) and line 45 of source file [CommandUtils.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/util/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/utils/CommandUtils.java).  
**Security Concern 6: XPath Injection(CWE-643)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-XPATH_INJECTION.pdf) is due to usage of javax/xml/xpath/XPath.compile in line 51 of source file [XpathUtils.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/config/config-api/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/XpathUtils.java).  
**Security Concern 7: Information Exposure Through DiscrepancyKey(CWE-203)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-UNSAFE_HASH_EQUALS.pdf) is due to usage of unsafe comparison of hash that are susceptible to timing attack in line 108 of source file [AgentUpgradeService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/agent/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/agent/service/AgentUpgradeService.java) and line 40 of source file [ChecksumValidator.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/validation/ChecksumValidator.java).  
**Security Concern 8: Open Redirect(CWE-601)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-UNVALIDATED_REDIRECT.pdf) is due to usage of unvalidated redirection in line 62 of source file [GoServerLoadingIndicationHandler.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/jetty9/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/server/GoServerLoadingIndicationHandler.java).  
**Security Concern 9: HTTP Parameter Pollution(CAPEC-460)**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-HTTP_PARAMETER_POLLUTION.pdf) is due to usage of unvalidated redirection in line 110 of source file [ServerBinaryDownloader.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/agent-common/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/agent/launcher/ServerBinaryDownloader.java), in line 115 of source file [AgentUpgradeService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/agent/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/agent/service/AgentUpgradeService.java) and line 156 of source file [HttpService.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/util/HttpService.java).  
**Security Concern 10: Malicious Code**  
This [concern](https://github.com/SA-Java-CCSW/CYBR8420ProjectGoCD/blob/master/CodeReview/SpotBugs-DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED.pdf) is due to creation of classloader not within a doPrivileged block in line 110/111 of source file [JarUtil.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/agent-common/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/agent/common/util/JarUtil.java). 

**Security Concern 11: Improper Handling of Parameters (CWE-233)**
This concern about situation in [BackupConfig.java](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/config/config-api/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/go/config/BackupConfig.java): software does not properly handle when the expected number of parameters, fields, or arguments is not provided in input, or if those parameters are undefined.

**Security Concern 12: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value (CWE-354)**  
This concern is about methods in setBackupDate, getBackupDate in class AppleForkedDateEntry that methods do not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values. 

**Security Concern 13: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption(CWE-400)**  
This concern is about software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource thereby enabling an actor to influence.

**Security Concern 14: External Control of Critical State Data(CWE-642)**
This concern is about method getScriptedObject stores security-critical state information about its users that is accessible to unauthorized actors.
